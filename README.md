## Design

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  We agreed that a couple dark colours mixed with bright colours would work for our website. Including red was important to convey the danger of terrorism. The colours picked were generated the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/colour-palette/colourpalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    - Google Fonts were used to import Roboto condensed, Roboto, and Kaina One fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they incorporate a lot of straight thick lines which comes across as oppressive. The fonts were tested for their effectiveness by how they made the word 'terrorism' look.
 
    ![Font Pairing](documentation/font-family/font-pair.png)   

-   ### Logo/Icon
    - The logo design incorporates the rock paper and scissors in a round.  The logo was generated using [favicon-converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
