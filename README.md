## Design

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  We agreed that a couple dark colours mixed with bright colours would work for our website. Including red was important to convey the danger of terrorism. The colours picked were generated the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

        ![Colour Palette](documentation/colour-palette/colourpalette.png)

-   ### Typography
    - Google Fonts were used to import Roboto condensed, Roboto, and Kaina One fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they incorporate a lot of straight thick lines which comes across as oppressive. The fonts were tested for their effectiveness by how they made the word 'terrorism' look.
 
    ![Font Pairing](documentation/font-family/font-pair.png)   

-   ### Logo/Icon
    - The logo design incorporates a shield and binoculars. The shield because Prevent seeks to protect, and binoculars because Prevent needs to look closely to spot signs of radicalisation. The logo was generated using [bing copilot designer](https://www.bing.com/chat?q=Microsoft+Copilot&FORM=hpcodx)
